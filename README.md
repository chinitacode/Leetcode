# Python_Learning
Study notes of python basics and advanced knowledge like socket programming, MySQL, multi-threads, multi-progress etc., data structure and algorithms, and records of some interview problems like Leetcode, and those collected from the Internet.

# List of Content 

+ ### [algorithms and datastructure](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/Algos) 
  In this file you can find the python implementations of datastructure like array, linked list, tree, graph, etc. and algorithms such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming and so on. 
  
+ ### [Leetcode problems and solutions by tags](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/ByTags) 
  This file also contains a tiny part of problems selected from 剑指Offer.

+ ### [50 Tencent interview problems and solutions on Leetcode](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/Tencent_50) 

+ ### [Top 100 interview problems on Leetcode](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/Top100) 
  
+ ### [Interview problems of Byte Dance](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/ByteDance) 

+ ### [Socket programming in Python](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/Socket) 
  This file contains the introduction practices of socket programming, and the implementation codes of a little chat app program,
  in which the simplest impletation is a [person to person chat app](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/Socket/chat_app/simplest),
  only supporting communication between the server and 1 client; and the more advanced impletation of a [multiplayer chat room](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/Socket/chat_app/chatroom) 
  using **multiple-threads**, which can be furthur divided into the TCP implementation and the UDP implementation. 

+ ### [Web Development](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/Web) 

+ ### [Regular expression](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/Regexp) 

+ ### [Practice of Python Unittest Module](https://github.com/chinitacode/Python_Learning/tree/master/Unittest)
